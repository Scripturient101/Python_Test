List operations and decoding

> two list are give below L1 , L2.
> create a new list called L3 containing items in below given pattern.
> From L1 it must take only odd index items.
> From L2 it must take only even index items.
> file name must be lnblist.py in which you are going to write the code.


# Question 5 :
